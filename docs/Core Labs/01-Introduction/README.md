**Type:** Reading & Conceptual Understanding

Welcome to the foundational module of our AI Red Teaming workshop. This module provides essential background knowledge that will prepare you for the hands-on exercises in the following modules.

## Module Structure

- [01 - What is AI Red Teaming?](./01-what-is-ai-red-teaming.md) *(5 minutes)*
- [02 - Risk Categories and Attack Strategies](./02-risk-categories-attack-strategies.md) *(5 minutes)*
- [03 - AI Red Teaming in Practice](./03-ai-red-teaming-in-practice.md) *(5 minutes)*

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will understand:

- The definition and purpose of AI red teaming
- How AI red teaming differs from traditional cybersecurity red teaming
- The four main risk categories in AI safety
- Common attack strategies and their complexity levels
- When and how to implement AI red teaming in your development lifecycle
- The role of automation in scaling AI safety testing

## Key Concepts Covered

### Core Terminology
- **AI Red Teaming**: Proactive testing for AI safety and security risks

### Risk Categories
- Violence and harmful content
- Sexual content
- Hateful and unfair content
- Self-harm related content

### Attack Strategies
- Easy complexity attacks (encoding, character manipulation)
- Moderate complexity attacks (using AI to generate attacks)
- Difficult complexity attacks (complex multi-step approaches)
