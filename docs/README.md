# Overview

Welcome to the hands-on workshop on **AI Red Teaming using Azure AI Foundry**. This workshop will take you from understanding core concepts to implementing and running AI red teaming scans both locally and in the cloud.

**Duration:** 75 minutes  
**Level:** Beginner to Intermediate  
**Prerequisites:** Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts and Python programming

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting this workshop, ensure you have:

- **Azure Subscription** with appropriate permissions
- **Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12** installed (PyRIT doesn't support Python 3.9)
- **Azure CLI** installed and configured
- **Basic familiarity** with Python development and Azure services
- **Access** to Azure AI Foundry (or willingness to create a free trial)


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** the fundamentals of AI red teaming and its importance in AI safety
2. **Identify** different risk categories and attack strategies used in AI red teaming
3. **Set up** and configure the AI Red Teaming Agent locally using PyRIT
4. **Execute** automated safety scans against AI models and applications
5. **Deploy** and manage AI red teaming in the cloud using Azure AI Foundry
6. **Analyze** results and interpret Attack Success Rate (ASR) metrics
7. **Implement** best practices for continuous AI safety monitoring

## Getting Started

The quickest way to start is to use GitHub Codespaces

1. **Fork this repository** to your personal profile
2. **Navigate** to fork in a new browser tab
3. Click the **Code** button, select **Codespaces** tab
4. Click the **Create Codespaces** button

This opens a new GitHub Codespaces session in a new browser tab. Wait till the session loads, then preview the instruction guide, next.


## Preview Guide

The repository is configured to use [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), a modern and customizable documentation framework for MkDocs. To preview the workshop guide:

1. Open a new VS Code Terminal in your Codespaces session
1. Run this command - you will see a dialog pop-up
    ```bash
    mkdocs serve
    ```
1. Select _Open in Browser_ - you should see (this page) previewed in the browser.
1. Click the [Core Labs](./Core%20Labs/01-intro/) page to get started!
