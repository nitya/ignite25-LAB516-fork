    "## Objective\n",
    "This notebook walks through how to use Azure AI Evaluation's AI Red Teaming Agent functionality to assess the safety and resilience of AI systems against adversarial prompt attacks. AI Red Teaming Agent leverages [Risk and Safety Evaluations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in?tabs=warning#risk-and-safety-evaluators) to help identify potential safety issues across different risk categories (violence, hate/unfairness, sexual content, self-harm) combined with attack strategies of varying complexity levels from [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT), Microsoft AI Red Teaming team's open framework for automated AI red teaming.\n",

    "## Understanding AI Red Teaming Agent's capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "The Azure AI Evaluation SDK's `RedTeam` functionality evaluates AI systems against adversarial prompts across multiple dimensions - including by risk categories and attack strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Risk Categories**: Different content risk categories your AI system might generate\n",
    "   - Violence\n",
    "   - HateUnfairness\n",
    "   - Sexual\n",
    "   - SelfHarm\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attack Strategies**: Along with standard unmodified prompts which are sent by default as the `baseline`, you can specify different transformations of prompts to elicit undesired content.\n",
    "You can also use `AttackStrategy.Compose()` to layer two strategies in one attack\n",
    "   - AnsiAttack: Using ANSI escape codes in prompts\n",
    "   - AsciiArt: Using ASCII art to disguise harmful content\n",
    "   - AsciiSmuggler: Hiding harmful content within ASCII characters\n",
    "   - Atbash: Using the Atbash cipher to encode harmful requests\n",
    "   - Base64: Encoding harmful content in Base64 format\n",
    "   - Binary: Converting text to binary to bypass filters\n",
    "   - Caesar: Using the Caesar cipher for encoding\n",
    "   - CharacterSpace: Manipulating character spacing to confuse filters\n",
    "   - CharSwap: Swapping characters to bypass detection\n",
    "   - Diacritic: Using diacritical marks to alter text appearance\n",
    "   - Flip: Flipping text to bypass content filters\n",
    "   - Leetspeak: Converting letters to numbers and symbols\n",
    "   - Morse: Using Morse code to encode harmful requests\n",
    "   - ROT13: Using ROT13 cipher for text transformation\n",
    "   - SuffixAppend: Adding suffixes to confuse detection systems\n",
    "   - StringJoin: Joining strings in unconventional ways\n",
    "   - Tense: Changing the tense of harmful requests to past tense\n",
    "   - UnicodeConfusable: Using similar-looking Unicode characters\n",
    "   - UnicodeSubstitution: Substituting characters with Unicode alternatives\n",
    "   - Url: Embedding harmful content within URLs\n",
    "   - Jailbreak: Specially crafted prompts to bypass AI safeguards\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complexity Levels**: Different difficultly levels of attacks\n",
    "   - Baseline: Standard functionality tests\n",
    "   - Easy: Simple attack patterns\n",
    "   - Moderate: More sophisticated attacks\n",
    "   - Difficult: Complex, layered attack strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "The key metric for evaluating results is the **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**, which measures the percentage of attacks that successfully elicit harmful content from your AI system.\n",

    "1. **Overall Attack Success Rate (ASR)** - The percentage of attacks that successfully elicit harmful content\n",
    "2. **Vulnerability by Risk Category** - Which types of harmful content your model is most vulnerable to\n",
    "3. **Effectiveness of Attack Strategies** - Which attack techniques are most successful against your model\n",
    "4. **Impact of Complexity** - How more sophisticated attacks affect your model's safety guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "By regularly red-teaming your AI applications, you can identify and address potential vulnerabilities before deploying your models to production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mitigation**: Use these results to strengthen your model's guardrails against identified attack vectors\n",
    "2. **Continuous Testing**: Implement regular red team evaluations as part of your development lifecycle\n",
    "3. **Custom Strategies**: Develop custom attack strategies for your specific use cases and domain\n",
    "4. **Safety Layers**: Consider adding additional safety layers like Azure AI Content Safety to filter harmful requests and responses "
