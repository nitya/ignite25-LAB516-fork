# Prompts Used To Create Content

1. Initial Scaffold

```bash
Use the Microsoft Docs MCP server and reference the documentation on AI red teaming - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/ai-red-teaming-agent - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/run-scans-ai-red-teaming-agent - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/run-ai-red-teaming-cloud?tabs=python


Using this create a workshop under the docs/ directory that a beginner can use to go from concepts to hands-on learning.

The workshop should be completed in 75 mins
Use one subfolder 01-intro to cover core concepts that learners can read in 15 mins

Then use additional subfolders one per bit task to cover running red team scans locally and in the cloud

Each subfolder should contain numbered units in markdown - where each unit gets learner through one subtask en route to completing the bigger task
