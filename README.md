## 🔥LAB516: Safeguard your agents with AI Red Teaming Agent in Azure AI Foundry

[![Microsoft Azure AI Foundry Discord](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/ByRwuEEgH4)](https://aka.ms/AIFoundryDiscord-Ignite25)
[![Azure AI Foundry Developer Forum](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Azure_AI_Foundry_Developer_Forum-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&color=adff2f&logoColor=fff)](https://aka.ms/AIFoundryForum-Ignite25)

### Session Description
This hands-on workshop will introduce participants to the fundamentals of [automated AI red teaming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/ai-red-teaming-agent) of generative AI systems for safety and security risks using Azure AI Foundry. Attendees will learn how to apply automated attack techniques to identify safety issues and security vulnerabilities across multiple risk dimensions before deployment. Participants will engage in hands-on walkthroughs and guided exercises to apply these concepts in realistic development scenarios.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- describe what the AI Red Teaming Agent does, and why it matters
- understand the risk categories and attack strategies for AI red teaming
- run an AI Red Teaming Agent scan locally - using the Azure AI Evaluation SDK
- run an AI Red Teaming Agent scan in cloud - using the Azure AI Foundry SDK
- view and analyze scan results - locally and in Azure AI Foundry Portal
- create and run custom scans using app-specific callbacks & prompts

### 💻 Technologies Used

1. Azure Developer CLI - for provisioning a basic AI Agent app
1. Azure AI Red Teaming Agent - for adversarial testing of your AI app
1. Azure AI Evaluation SDK - for code-first setup & execution of scans
1. Azure AI Foundry Portal - for viewing red teaming scan results 

### 🚀 Getting Started

This lab is setup for both instructor-led sessions (using the Skillable environment) and for self-guided sessions (using your own Azure subscription at home). In both cases, you will need to take these three steps to proceed further:

1. **Fork The Repository** to get your own copy
   - Log into GitHub using your personal account
   - [Fork this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite25-LAB516-safeguard-your-agents-with-ai-red-teaming-agent-in-azure-ai-foundry/fork) - then open the fork in a new browser tab.

1. **Launch GitHub Codespaces** to get your development environment
   - Click the blue "Code" button in your fork - select "Codespaces" tab
   - Click the "+" button to create a new codespace - it opens a new tab
   - You will see a VS Code editor in the browser - wait till it loads

1. **Launch Workshop Guide** to get a web-based instruction guide 
   - Open the VS Code terminal in the IDE above - wait till prompt is active
   - Type `mkdocs serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &` - a dialog will pop up in a few seconds
   - Select "Open in browser" option - a web-based guide will open in a new tab
   - Click the **Begin Here** tab in navigation - follow instructions there!

**Note:** The web-based guide has three useful features:

- Built in search - quickly look up commands or sections on-demand
- Theme modes - toggle between dark and light themes to suit preference
- Easy copy/paste - hover on code-fenced region, click "copy to clipboard" icon

At the end of this step you should have a browser open with three tabs:

- [X] GitHub Repository tab - from which you launched codespaces
- [X] GitHub Codespaces tab - which is your development environment
- [X] Workshop Guide tab - which will provide step-by-step walkthroughs

_You are now ready to continue the workshop using the guide_.
