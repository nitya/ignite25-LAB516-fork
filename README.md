## 🔥LAB516: Safeguard your agents with AI Red Teaming Agent in Azure AI Foundry

[![Microsoft Azure AI Foundry Discord](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/ByRwuEEgH4)](https://aka.ms/AIFoundryDiscord-Ignite25)
[![Azure AI Foundry Developer Forum](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Azure_AI_Foundry_Developer_Forum-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&color=adff2f&logoColor=fff)](https://aka.ms/AIFoundryForum-Ignite25)

### Who Should Take This Lab?

This lab is ideal for:

1. **AI Developers** who want to improve the security posture of their apps
1. **Cloud Architects** evaluating security tools & practices for AI solutions
1. **AI Beginners** who want to learn AI Red Teaming tools & concepts

**Pre-Requisites**: We assume basic familiarity with AI application develoment and the AI Ops lifecycle. The lab uses GitHub Codespaces, VS Code & Python Notebooks - familiarity with these is ideal. You **must** have a GitHub account to get started.


### Session Description
This hands-on workshop will introduce participants to the fundamentals of [automated AI red teaming](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/ai-red-teaming-agent) of generative AI systems for safety and security risks using Azure AI Foundry. Attendees will learn how to apply automated attack techniques to identify safety issues and security vulnerabilities across multiple risk dimensions before deployment. Participants will engage in hands-on walkthroughs and guided exercises to apply these concepts in realistic development scenarios.

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this session, learners will be able to:

- describe what the AI Red Teaming Agent does and why it matters for AI safety
- identify and test against core risk categories with diverse attack strategies 
- configure and test different target types (callbacks, models & app endpoints)
- run AI Red Teaming Agent scans locally and in the cloud (using Azure AI SDKs)
- analyze scan results & metrics locally and in the cloud (using Azure AI Foundry Portal)
- compare baseline and advanced attack strategies for a real-world scenario

### 💻 Technologies Used

1. [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview) - for provisioning a basic AI Agent app
1. [Azure AI Foundry Portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/what-is-azure-ai-foundry) - for project management and viewing scan results
1. [Azure AI Foundry SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ai-projects-readme) - for cloud-based red teaming operations
1. [Azure AI Red Teaming Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/concepts/ai-red-teaming-agent) - for adversarial testing of your AI app
1. [Azure AI Evaluation SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/how-to/develop/evaluate-sdk) - for local setup & execution of scans
1. [Azure AI Agents](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview) - for creating intelligent agents with tools and custom functions
1. [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/openai/overview) - for accessing GPT-4 and other language models
1. [PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/PyRIT) - Python Risk Identification Tool framework underlying the red teaming agent

### 🚀 Getting Started

This lab is setup for both instructor-led sessions (pre-provisioned Skillable subscription) and self-guided learning (manually provisioned with your own Azure subscription). In both cases, we _recommend_ using the following approach for a quick start.

1. **Create a personal copy** of the repo to make changes.
   - Log into GitHub using your personal account
   - [Fork this repo](https://github.com/microsoft/ignite25-LAB516-safeguard-your-agents-with-ai-red-teaming-agent-in-azure-ai-foundry/fork) to get your personal copy. 
   - Open the fork in a new browser tab.

1. **Launch GitHub Codespaces** to get your development environment
   - Click the blue "Code" button in your fork - select "Codespaces" tab
   - Click the "+" button to create a new codespace - it opens a new tab
   - You will see a VS Code editor in the browser - wait till it loads

1. **Launch Workshop Guide** to get a web-based instruction guide 
   - Open the VS Code terminal in the IDE above - wait till prompt is active
   - Type `mkdocs serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &` - a dialog will pop up in a few seconds
   - Select "Open in browser" option - a web-based guide will open in a new tab
   - Click the **Begin Here** tab in navigation - follow instructions there!

Using the web-based instruction guide has three benefits:

1. **Search effectively** - quickly look up commands or sections on-demand
1. **Copy/Paste quickly** - hover on code regions to see _copy to clipboard_ option
1. **Toggle theme** - setup for light and dark theme modes to suit your preference

_You should now have a browser with three open tabs:_

- [X] GitHub Repository tab - from which you launched codespaces
- [X] GitHub Codespaces tab - which is your development environment
- [X] Workshop Guide tab - which will provide step-by-step walkthroughs

Ready to get to work? Let's go! 🚀
